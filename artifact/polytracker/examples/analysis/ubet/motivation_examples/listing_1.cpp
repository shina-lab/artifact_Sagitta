/* Consider the following (buggy) toy parser, which accepts at least one
 * command-line argument.
 *
 * With optimizations disabled, Clang / LLVM 15.0.0 run on the code in Listing
 * 1 will produce a binary that operates consistently dependent on input. Due
 * to undefined behavior in the first branch of the conditional, a program
 * version compiled with optimizations (-03) will only return 0;
 * Clang elides the undefined behavior during optimization.
 *
 * Listing 1: According to the C++20 specification, a bitwise left shift
 * operation (as on line 9 here) results in undefined behavior if the right
 * operand is negative.
 *
 * Listing 2: Assembly of the program in Listing 1 when compiled with Clangâ€™s
 * -O3 optimization level. All of the control flow has been silently elided,
 * and the program will always return 0.
 * main:
 *     xor %eax, %eax
 *     retq
 * The clear difference in the simple examples of program control flow in
 * Listings 1 and 2 reflect potential effects of optimization passes run
 * on code invoking undefined behavior.
