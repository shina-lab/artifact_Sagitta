=== Validation Information
In phase 4, confirm that the generated localization graph (in svg format) corresponds to Figure 5.


--- Success criteria for Phase 4
1. Root cause node "crash-000117[0x7a2]" can be found.
2. All 4 key nodes (root cause, node 2, node 3, node 4) appear in sequence.
3. The data flow path connects these nodes with directed edges.
4. The terminal node shows MAGMA_LOG (equivalent to the crash site in Figure 5).


--- Guidance for phase 4
We recommend to view the svg file in your favorite web browser.
The generated localization graph is large and does not fit on the screen. 

For efficient artifact evaluation, we navigate you along this graph.
First, we visit the upstream of the graph.
Search for "crash-000117[0x7a2]" using the browser's in-page search (Ctrl+F), and the vertex node labeled as the root cause in Figure 5 will appear on your screen.
Follow the direction of the arrows and trace the graph toward the downstream side.

Then, you will encounter the difference highlighted (colored) node "v32 = (uint32_t) va_arg(ap, uint32_t);".
Continue tracing the graph toward the downstream side.

Next, you will encounter the node "td->td_tilewidth = v32;". 
This is node 2 necessary for explaining the root cause of TIF008.
Continue tracing the graph toward the downstream side.
There will be a branch after this.
Follow the path that leads to the "imagewidth = tif->tif_dir.td_tilewidth;". 
This is node 3 necessary for explaining the root cause of TIF008.
Continue tracing the graph toward the downstream side.

You will encounter the node "while (n-- > 0 && npixels < imagewidth)" labeled as dominance integration in Figure 5. 
This is node 4 necessary for explaining the root cause of TIF008.
Follow the thick blue edge labeled "dominates" that extends from this node.

At last, you will arrive at "MAGMA_LOG("TIF008", op_offset >= scanline);", the terminal node of the localization graph.

You may notice that the code shown at the crash site in Figure 5 differs from the code of the bottommost node in the generated localization graph, but in conclusion, this is not a problem.
The code where the crash actually occurs is SETPIXEL(op, grey); is displayed for clarifying in Figure 5.
On the other hand, Magma's canary MAGMA_LOG---displayed in the svg---is code that determines the occurrence of a crash (refer to our paper section 6.1 Dataset for details), and since we used it as the starting point to generate the localization graph.

The following code is the libtiff source code around the crash location.
Ultimately, both of SETPIXEL and MAGMA_LOG refer to the same location in the code, so this display difference is not a problem.

```
                while (n-- > 0 && npixels < imagewidth)
#endif
                {
#ifdef MAGMA_ENABLE_CANARIES
                    MAGMA_LOG("TIF008", op_offset >= scanline); // Code displayed by the localization graph
#endif
					SETPIXEL(op, grey); // Actual crash site. Code displayed in Figure 5
                }
```

Phase 4 and claim 1 is over. Thank you.


--- Appendix: List of source code and input/output files
Through Claim 1, we will show the role of each component and script so that the overall picture of the artifact can be traced.

Software components (source code): 
    (1) Magma framework (modified by us in section 6.1): artifact/magma-v1.2 
    (1-2) Supplemental header file for (1): artifact/try-clang
    (2) polytracker (modified by us in section 5): artifact/polytracker
    (3) our tool (implemented in section 5): artifact/taint_tracking
    (4) our analysis pipeline tailored for (3) (used in section 6.3): artifact/evaluation/libtiff-TIF008/run.sc

Input pair (picked in section 6.1): 
    In evaluation/input-file/7fcf1f3ea2333be518eac93dc8bcfc276272db21,
        non-crash input: 004839
        crash input: crash-000117

Output format: SVG (for graphing).
